The libraries presented below have been crafted using lecture notes from a course on numerical computing (Mark Holmes, 2014) 
and West's Introduction to Graph Theory, 2nd Edition. Auxilliary libraries included in this project contain input/output wrappers and crude algorithms used to "get by" until greater algorithms come along.

This project is written in C++ and utilizes the Armadillo linear algebra library. 

Critiques are encouraged.
